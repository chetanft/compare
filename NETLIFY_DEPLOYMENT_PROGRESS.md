# Netlify Deployment Progress Report

This document summarizes the progress made in implementing the plan to make the Figma Comparison Tool production-ready for Netlify deployment.

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### Environment Configuration & Validation
- Created centralized environment validation module for Netlify functions (`netlify/functions/utils/environment.js`)
- Updated deployment script to check for required environment variables
- Added validation for critical environment variables like `FIGMA_API_KEY`

### API Endpoint Standardization
- Updated netlify.toml with proper redirects for API endpoints
- Standardized API routes between local server and Netlify functions
- Fixed path handling in the frontend API service

### Figma API Integration Fixes
- Added better error handling for Figma API token scope issues
- Implemented more descriptive error messages for API errors
- Added validation for API token on startup

### WebSocket Alternatives
- Added fallback mechanism for WebSocket functionality in Netlify
- Created socket-fallback endpoint to handle WebSocket requests gracefully
- Updated frontend to detect Netlify environment and disable WebSocket features

### Static Asset Handling
- Created static file handler function for Netlify (`netlify/functions/static.js`)
- Updated netlify.toml to route static asset requests to the static function
- Added proper MIME type detection and caching for static files

### Error Handling Standardization
- Added centralized error handling middleware to Netlify functions
- Standardized error response format across all API endpoints
- Improved error logging with more context

### Configuration Management
- Moved hardcoded values to environment variables
- Created centralized configuration system for Netlify functions
- Added environment-specific feature flags

### CORS Configuration
- Standardized CORS settings across all environments
- Updated netlify.toml with proper CORS headers for API endpoints
- Added CORS headers for Netlify functions

### Notification System Updates
- Made notification banner in App.tsx configurable based on environment
- Added environment-specific notifications for feature limitations
- Implemented dynamic banner styling based on message type

### Testing and Verification
- Created test script for Netlify functions (`netlify/functions/test-functions.js`)
- Added test execution to deployment script
- Implemented validation for deployment package completeness

## ðŸ”„ In Progress Tasks

### Report Generation Optimization
- Need to optimize report generation for serverless environment
- Implement chunked processing to stay within function timeout limits
- Add caching for generated reports

### Frontend Environment Detection
- Further improve environment detection logic
- Add more specific handling for Netlify deployment
- Implement feature detection based on environment

## ðŸ“‹ Remaining Tasks

### API Fallback Mechanism
- Update fallback responses to match the current API structure
- Implement a more dynamic fallback system
- Add more comprehensive fallbacks for all API endpoints

### Missing Dependencies
- Ensure all required dependencies are properly listed in function package.json files
- Test functions in isolation to verify dependencies
- Optimize dependencies for faster cold starts

## ðŸ§ª Testing Checklist

Before final deployment, verify the following:

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Ensure `FIGMA_API_KEY` is properly set in Netlify dashboard
   - Set `NODE_VERSION` to 18 in Netlify dashboard

2. **API Endpoints**
   - Test all API endpoints in Netlify environment
   - Verify error handling works correctly
   - Check CORS headers are properly set

3. **Static Assets**
   - Verify reports can be accessed
   - Check images and screenshots are properly served
   - Test caching behavior

4. **Frontend Features**
   - Ensure UI correctly reflects available features
   - Verify notification banners show appropriate messages
   - Test fallback mechanisms for unavailable features

## ðŸš€ Deployment Instructions

1. Run the updated deployment script:
   ```bash
   ./deploy-netlify.sh
   ```

2. Upload the generated `netlify-deploy.zip` to Netlify or connect your GitHub repository

3. Set required environment variables in the Netlify dashboard:
   - `FIGMA_API_KEY`: Your Figma API token
   - `NODE_VERSION`: 18

4. Deploy and verify functionality
