# DevRev Issues Table - User Guide

## Overview

The HTML comparison reports now include a **DevRev-ready Issues Table** that transforms design discrepancies into a structured issue tracker format. This feature provides an instant, browser-based view of all issues with export capabilities.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. **Comprehensive Issue Format**
Every issue includes 16 essential columns:
- **Issue ID** - Auto-incremented unique identifier
- **Title / Summary** - Auto-generated descriptive title
- **Description** - Detailed explanation of the discrepancy
- **Module / Feature** - Extracted from Figma file name or web URL
- **Frame / Component Name** - Direct from Figma extraction (e.g., "Button.Primary.Save")
- **Figma Component ID** - For linking back to Figma
- **Component Type** - FRAME, COMPONENT, INSTANCE, TEXT
- **Web Element** - HTML tag and class (e.g., "button.btn-primary")
- **Severity** - Critical / Major / Minor (auto-calculated)
- **Priority** - Urgent / High / Medium / Low (auto-calculated)
- **Status** - Default "Open"
- **Expected Result** - From Figma design
- **Actual Result** - From web implementation
- **Environment** - Auto-detected (Development/Staging/Production)
- **Created Date** - Timestamp
- **Remarks** - Context and recommendations

### 2. **Auto-Calculated Severity**
```javascript
Color Difference:
  > 30%  → Critical
  10-30% → Major
  < 10%  → Minor

Missing Component → Major
Typography Mismatch → Major
Spacing Mismatch → Minor
```

### 3. **Smart Priority Calculation**
```javascript
Base Priority (from Severity):
  Critical → High
  Major    → Medium
  Minor    → Low

Priority Boost for Interactive Components:
  Button, Input, Link, CTA → +1 level
  
Examples:
  - "Button.Primary.Save" + Major → High (boosted from Medium)
  - "Background Frame" + Minor → Low (no boost)
```

### 4. **Export Capabilities**
- **CSV Export** - Client-side generation, no backend needed
- **Copy to Clipboard** - Paste directly into Excel or DevRev
- **Print to PDF** - Use browser's print function
- **Filter & Search** - Real-time table filtering
- **Column Sorting** - Click headers to sort
