## 📋 Report Features

### **Header Section:**
- Title: "DevRev Issues Report"
- Metadata: Generated timestamp, component counts, total issues
- Warning notice: Explains current existence-only checks

### **DevRev Issues Table:**
Columns included:
- Issue ID
- Title / Summary
- Description
- Module
- Frame / Component Name (from Figma)
- Figma ID
- Type
- Web Element
- Severity (Critical/Major/Minor)
- Priority (Urgent/High/Medium/Low)
- Status (Open)
- Expected Result
- Actual Result
- Environment
- Created Date
- Remarks

### **Interactive Controls:**
- **Export as CSV** - Download spreadsheet format
- **Copy Table** - Copy for pasting to DevRev/Jira
- **Filter** - Search/filter issues
- **Sort** - Click column headers to sort
- **Statistics** - Live counts of Critical/Major/Minor issues

---

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

**Only existence checks are performed:**
- ✅ Missing components detected
- ❌ Color comparisons (not yet implemented)
- ❌ Typography comparisons (not yet implemented)
- ❌ Spacing comparisons (not yet implemented)

**Why?**  
The comparison engine (`src/services/comparison/comparisonEngine.js`) only checks if components exist. It doesn't compare actual design token properties.

**What's Ready?**
- ✅ Report design supports all issue types
- ✅ IssueFormatter handles all deviation types
- ✅ Just waiting for comparison engine to provide the data
